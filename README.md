This arduio sketch is for a RP2040 Zero microcontroller.
It will likley need adjustment for use in other controllers, but it's not using anything special, so should work fine.

In this version, I have added code that supports two of the current sensors - One on the input reading battery voltage & curent, the other on the regulator output, reading the current and voltage there.
